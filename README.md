# steamee
## Full-stack Application Project
==link to live site==

## Overview
This is a full-stack Node application designed to help users discover and suggest local co-op games available on Steam. All too frequently, couples, friends, or just any two strangers in a room, scour the internet for good local co-op games, just to find the same three websites, recommending the same handful of games they've already played! It's time to get steamee!

### Technologies Used:
- Mongoose
- MongoDb
- Express
- Morgan
- Postman
- bcryptjs
- Liquid express views
- Axios
- Internal Steam Web API [^5]
    - particularly - GET search/results [^6]
- JavaScript
- packages: Node, Nodemon, dotenv, method-override, express-session, connect-mongo

## User stories
**As a user, I want the ability to** 
- sign up
- sign in
- sign out
- view a list of local co-op games directly from Steam's API
- view the list of local co-op games fellow steamees have suggested
- save games to my user account
- indicate if I've played this game as local co-op
- leave a rating out of 5 for the game
- leave a comment on a game
- delete a comment I made
- view comments from other users
- create a new game entry
- Update a saved game entry I made
- view only my game entries & saved games
- delete only my saved game entry
### Development
- sort & the list by the steamee rating
- see how many users have saved the game to their account
- search & filter steamee games
- see more features of games such as genre
- see more results from Steam
- generate error when adding a game that is not local co-op
- share my user collections publicly or with specific users
- see more store pages/platforms/media - such as boardgames, https://api-docs.igdb.com/#getting-started, PlayStation, Xbox, etc.
- select from existing custom collection name

## Approach taken
**Rough Draft Description of Approach:** 
- On the Steam store screen, an API call will get a filtered list of Steam games to display as cards in the views. 
- Users can "save" the game to their personal profile if they haven't already been saved, or can view the steamee game card, which will contain user ratings entered on steamee. If the user wants to dig deeper, they will with view (show route) the game and be able to see user comments. 
- When users suggest a new game, a document will be created from the Game model.
- Eventually, the steamee view-all page will contain other games added by users, in addition to the ones that were saved directly from the steam store API call.
- Example API Call: https://store.steampowered.com/search/results/?filter=category3=39&tags=3841&ignore_preferences=1&sort_by=Reviews_DESC&supportedlang=english&json=1
    - shared/split screen (category3=39)
    - local co-op tag (tags=3841)
    - sorted by reviews (sort_by=Reviews_DESC)
    - english games (supportedlang=english)
    - json format (json=1)
    - preferences ignored (ignore_preferences=1)
RESULTS:
```

    "items": [
        {
            "name": "Rhythm of the Night",

        },
```
- STRETCH GOAL (completed): Users can enter their own games, and if they include a steam id (found in the url of the game's store page after app/NNNNNNN, an API call using the GET /broadcast/ajaxgetbatchappcapsuleinfo will link in other information about the game. Example store page url: https://store.steampowered.com/app/312530/Duck_Game/
- Example API Call: https://store.steampowered.com/broadcast/ajaxgetbatchappcapsuleinfo?appids=312530&cc=NL&l=english&origin=https:%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com

## Installation instructions
**Using the application**
- When utilizing steamee, the intention is to interact with games that users have suggested through this application, not with the Steam store page, other than to find other games to suggest without having to go to Steam's store pages.
- Browse games other users have suggested under the "get steamee" section.
- Save games to your profile in custom collections that others have suggested by hitting the add heart icon from the get steamee page
- Edit the collection that your game belongs to easily by hitting the edit heart button from your saved games, or delete by hitting the trash can
- Suggest games in the "give steamee" section by browsing the Steam store API call results or by creating a new suggestion
- Leave comments and/or ratings on a game when you view the game from the "get steamee" section or when viewing from your profile of saved games

## Unsolved problems
- Multiple of the same Steam game could be added. Had to remove the unique: true of the steamId property in game model as multiple games with no steam ID were able to be added.
- Deleting games from the game collection does not remove the game from saved games
- Editing/deleting games from the game collection - this is meant to be an administrative task, shortterm work arounds are present
- The Steam store API call is limited, therefore multiple API calls would make the store page more robust/dynamic
- Author not populating on saved games show page for comments

    }, 
    author: {
        type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
        ref: 'User', 
        required: true
    }
    }, {
    timestamps: true
    })
    ```
        - savedGamesSchema:
    ```javascript
    const savedGameSchema = new Schema ({
    owner: {
        type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
        ref: 'User', 
        required: true
    },
    savedGameRef: {
